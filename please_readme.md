# Please unlock github discussions for this project

I apologize in advance for using this....unorthodox...method of reaching out to you guys, but with the way that you all have locked down this project, this was the only way I could think of.  **The github discussions for this project are locked down so that only contributors to the project may open or reply to a discussion.**  Considering that it is you advise users to open a discussion in the event that they think they have found a bug, I am going to assume that that was by accident.  In any event, would please unlock the github discussions so that people can open discussions to report bugs.  I have had a bug report that I have wanted to report for many, many months now and have been unable to because the project repo is locked down like fort Knox!!!  Feel free to deny and delete this pull request, but please open up the discussions for this project.  Or provide some advice as to how non-contributors to this project can report bugs for the project.
